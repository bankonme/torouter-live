There seems to be no official debian package for ttdnsd, and the old ~squeeze
torouter package didn't seem to work with debian live. debhelper makes it easy
enough to rebuild a package on an ARM device itself.

The source can be grabbed from:

    https://gitweb.torproject.org/ioerror/ttdnsd.git

Build dependancy packages are:

    debhelper build-essential tsocks fakeroot

Then do:

    make deb

Copied out the resulting file (it ends up in ./..) and put that in
packages.chroot for now.
