Always use the unstable version of live-build in your host build machine. At
the time of writing this means version 3.0~a67-1. You can grab the one-off .deb
here:

### Errors when building flat ("plain") filesystem images

When building a chroot-filesystem=none image, if you encounter:

    cp: cannot create regular file `binary/live/filesystem.packages': No such file or directory

You will need to:

    mkdir binary/live
    rm -rf cache/binary_rootfs

If you don't run the second line as well, you will get the error:

    cp: cannot stat `cache/binary_rootfs/filesystem.*': No such file or directory

### mksquashfs Segfaults in qemu

mksquashfs always segfaults when run inside of qemu. Perhaps due to large
memory requirements of mksquashfs?

One hack workaround is to install the squashfs-tools in the host build system,
then edit the file /usr/lib/live/build/binary_rootfs and around line 377
comment out:

    Chroot chroot "mksquashfs chroot filesystem.squashfs ${MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS}"

and insert:

    cd chroot
    mksquashfs chroot filesystem.squashfs ${MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS}
    cd ..

Previously tried adding the following mksquashfs arguments, but they didn't fix
the problem:

    export MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS="-processors 1 -read-queue 8 -write-queue 16 -fragment-queue 8"

### squashfs image too small

The Calculate_partition_size function seems to be too optimistic; sometimes
images will not fit in the generated partitions.

Add the following below line 132 of /usr/lib/live/build/binary_hdd in your host
environment to add an extra 50MB to the partition size (probably way more than
necessary):

    DU_DIM="$(echo 50 + $DU_DIM | bc)"
