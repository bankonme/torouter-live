serial login debugging:
- perhaps related to symlink issue?
- user not being created correctly?
- init seems to be the problem: doesn't respect inittab
    - maybe due to earlier init not completing? known problem w/ rc.local
    - 'init s' then canceling brings up login correctly
    - ordering of script might be the problem? tried moving to 010-*
- add "dhclient eth0" to 9999-* and "echo root:crud | chpasswd" script to
  enable remote login and set root password (for debugging with a router+ssh)
- tried removing modprobe.d and sysctl.conf files
- mildly shifted u-boot parameters around...
- perhaps a new or changed set of packages? or a package dependancy?
- also, haven't been building regularly due to missing symlink problem
- tried using pinned sid version of live-* packages, also update build
  machine's live-*
- WORKED BEFORE ARG

- suspicious packages:
    - tcpd
    - u-boot
    - resolveconf
    - xauth
    - module-init-tools
    - krb5-locales
    - keyboard-configuration
    - flash-kernel
    - devio
    - dbus
    - bind9-host
    - user-setup
    - sudo
- removed sid pinning crap
- moved serial console fixer back to default
- still have missing symlink problem! due to kernel mangle hook? ownership?
