- ROOT PASSSWORD IS "CRUD" AND ROOT SSH IS ALLOWED
- test persistance
- uap hacks as a debian package
    - create m-a source package
    - build on dreamplug, save binary result; automate this?
- cross-networks are leaky! need to fix proxy script?
- ifdown of uap0 doesn't work
- (re)test with actual connectivity
- verify that ttdnsd requests are actually going via tsocks
- timing analysis:
    https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6588
- upstream: python-augeas requires libpython2.7
- add debug/success message to proxy init.d script

tor:
    Nov 23 17:33:45.000 [warn] Rejecting request for anonymous connection to
    private address [scrubbed] on a TransPort or NATDPort.  Possible loop in
    your NAT rules?

TBD:
- enable tor rc.d at boot
- basic throttling of uap0 and/or tor network traffic
- switch have TorDNS and ttdns only listen on 127.0.0.1
- should get date/time before starting tor
    - include and run tlsdate after dhcpclient
    - ntpdate after dhcpclient
    - use browser trick a la openwrt
- custom kernel (grsec etc)

- ipv6 routing on wifi
- real tor permissions fix
- persistant setuid issue
- determine which configurations can be settled using debconf preseeds
    http://live.debian.net/manual/html/live-manual.en.html#495
- network stuff: use if-up.d/if-down.d/etc
- remove unnecessary tty2+ lines completely from /etc/inittab
- ntp.conf
- faster boots
    uInitrd load: try removing largest contents, or read uncompressed?
