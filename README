### Build Requirements

Only tested on a debian wheezy host with many development packages already
installed; YMMV.

Install live-build and qemu:

    sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static qemu-utils debootstrap live-build

You need a recent version of live-build because of a secring.gpg-related error
(see http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2012/07/msg00122.html); download the
sid package (from http://packages.debian.org/sid/live-build) and install:

    sudo dpkg -i live-build_3.0~a67-1_all.deb

You might also want the Debian Live manuals:

    sudo apt-get install live-manual-html

### Build an Image

Once the above build requirements are satisfied:

    lb config
    lb build

### Develop

Basic configuration options are in ./auto/config
